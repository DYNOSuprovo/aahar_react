# 🥗 AI Diet Suggestion System (Indian Edition) - AAHAR

> **AAHAR** (Advanced Assistant for Healthy Alimentary Recommendations) is a highly sophisticated, context-aware AI agent designed to navigate the complex landscape of Indian dietary habits. It leverages an Agentic RAG pipeline to provide culturally relevant, nutritionally grounded, and environmentally aware food advice.

## 📸 Project Overview

**AAHAR** intelligently provides regionally-aware and dietary-type-specific Indian food suggestions using a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline, conversational memory, and fallback LLM integrations via Groq.

It understands queries like:
> *"Suggest a South Indian vegetarian dinner plan for diabetes."*
> *"What is the nutritional difference between Dal Makhani and Mixed Dal?"*
> *"Analyze my meal: 2 Rotis, 1 cup of Chana Masala, and a bowl of curd."*

## 🧠 Core Intelligence Features

### 1. Agentic Orchestration Loop
Unlike standard chatbots, AAHAR uses a self-correcting **6-iteration agent loop**. The orchestrator (Gemini 2.5 Flash) analyzes the query, selects the appropriate tool (Weather, RAG, Nutrition Fact, or Recipe), observes the output in a scratchpad, and iteratively refines its response until it meets the user's specific goals.

### 2. Multi-Tier Nutrition Search Engine
The system employs a sophisticated search strategy for its 1.3MB Indian food database:
*   **Tier 1 (Exact):** Direct mapping for common dishes.
*   **Tier 2 (Regex/Substring):** Identifies variations within category names.
*   **Tier 3 (Fuzzy Logic):** Powered by `fuzzywuzzy` with a token-set ratio scorer (>85 threshold) to handle typos like "Paneer Tika" vs "Paneer Tikka."

### 3. Integrated Meal Analyzer
The `/analyze-meal` engine provides professional-grade nutritional critiques:
*   **Numeric Aggregation:** Calculates exact totals for Calories, Protein, Carbs, Sugar, Fats, Fiber, and Sodium from a list of consumed dishes.
*   **AI Critique:** Gemini analyzes the aggregated totals to provide a 3-5 sentence professional assessment of the meal's balance, caloric density, and health suitability.

### 4. Hyper-Local Cultural Awareness
The system's metadata extraction engine is tuned for the Indian subcontinent:
*   **Regions:** Maps cities to specific cuisines (e.g., Patna -> **Bihari**, Lucknow -> **Awadhi**, Kolkata -> **Bengali**).
*   **Goals:** Understands the difference between "bulking," "clean bulking," "shredding," and "belly fat reduction."
*   **Weather Awareness:** Automatically fetches real-time data to suggest **cooling foods** in heatwaves or **warming meals** during winters.
